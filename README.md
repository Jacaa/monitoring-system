# Monitoring system

### Assumption
A web application for visualizing and analyzing data. The data presents number of people who walked in/out to the room, building etc., and another info about the event like date or photo of the event.

Users can also set if they want get notifications when events happen.

### Important note
A program for generating data is in my other repository [peoples-counter-ms](https://github.com/Jacaa/peoples-counter-ms).

### Functionality
This application contains:
* logging in via Google account,
* filtering data,
* sorting data,
* nice charts by [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/),
* remote access to the camera view streamed by the server.

Note:
At this moment the camera view is not working because I haven't access to RaspberryPi.
